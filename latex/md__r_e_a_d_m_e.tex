i\+Cyber\+Security Inc.

You are to create an on-\/line pamphlet for i\+Cyber\+Security Inc. The company provides methodologies so organizations can detect, respond to, and contain advanced cyber security attacks.

You must implement the vector class as outlined in the \hyperlink{vector_8h_source}{vector.\+h} specification below. Vector will be used to store the i\+Cyber\+Security customer list. Your vector class is a close approximation to the S\+TL vector class. Vector supports the following basic operations\+: constructors for one or more arguments, default constructors, copy constructor, copy assignment, move constructor, move assignment and destructor. Vector also supports a basic iterator member type and member function begin() and end() operations. A partial outline/implementation of the above will be provided to the team.

Design a very readable, easy to use interface to demonstrate your program. Contingency handling should include addressing invalid input. No late projects will be accepted. Your team must demonstrate your project to me before it will be graded. Each teammate must identify their accomplishments on the project.

Write at least 10 agile stories before any software is developed. Each story must be in the proper format (As a …). Each story must contain a detailed description, assignee, story point estimation, priority, list of tasks and tests, and definition of done. The team must identify a baseline story with a story point value of one. The team must follow the Scrum process (the Scrum master must document all meetings and the product owner must document the backlog).

Submit a U\+ML class diagram, at least three use cases, and at least one state diagram with your project.

The team must follow the Scrum process. The Scrum master must log all team meetings (i.\+e. daily scrum) and document the sprint backlog. The product owner must document the backlog.

Run Doxygen on your source code.

Teams must use QT, D\+O\+X\+Y\+G\+EN, and G\+IT. Only team members should have access to their repository.

Please let me know who your teammates will be by November 29th (two points will be deducted from your score if you do not meet this deadline). All projects are due by December 8th.
