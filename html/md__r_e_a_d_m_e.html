<div class="textblock"><p>iCyberSecurity Inc.</p>
<p>You are to create an on-line pamphlet for iCyberSecurity Inc. The company provides methodologies so organizations can detect, respond to, and contain advanced cyber security attacks.</p>
<p>You must implement the vector class as outlined in the <a class="el" href="vector_8h_source.html">vector.h</a> specification below. Vector will be used to store the iCyberSecurity customer list. Your vector class is a close approximation to the STL vector class. Vector supports the following basic operations: constructors for one or more arguments, default constructors, copy constructor, copy assignment, move constructor, move assignment and destructor. Vector also supports a basic iterator member type and member function begin() and end() operations. A partial outline/implementation of the above will be provided to the team.</p>
<p>Design a very readable, easy to use interface to demonstrate your program. Contingency handling should include addressing invalid input. No late projects will be accepted. Your team must demonstrate your project to me before it will be graded. Each teammate must identify their accomplishments on the project.</p>
<p>Write at least 10 agile stories before any software is developed. Each story must be in the proper format (As a …). Each story must contain a detailed description, assignee, story point estimation, priority, list of tasks and tests, and definition of done. The team must identify a baseline story with a story point value of one. The team must follow the Scrum process (the Scrum master must document all meetings and the product owner must document the backlog).</p>
<p>Submit a UML class diagram, at least three use cases, and at least one state diagram with your project.</p>
<p>The team must follow the Scrum process. The Scrum master must log all team meetings (i.e. daily scrum) and document the sprint backlog. The product owner must document the backlog.</p>
<p>Run Doxygen on your source code.</p>
<p>Teams must use QT, DOXYGEN, and GIT. Only team members should have access to their repository.</p>
<p>Please let me know who your teammates will be by November 29th (two points will be deducted from your score if you do not meet this deadline). All projects are due by December 8th.</p>
<p>Final checkpoint – December 6th</p>
<p>The iCyberSecurity on-line pamphlet must:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Contain a sales pitch that includes key selling points of iCyberSecurity Inc keeping the target market in mind.</li>
<li>Provide at least three service options along with corresponding prices</li>
<li>Provide “contact us” methods</li>
<li>Your program should read from a customer file that keeps track of which companies have already received the pamphlet. There is a corresponding customer rating (very interested, somewhat interested, not interested, never call again). Some customers are considered key while other customers are considered “nice to have”. Customer names must be unique.</li>
<li>Your program should be able to update the customer list (change customer rating, the “key” field, address, etc.) – administrator only</li>
<li>Your program should be able to add and delete customers. – administrator only</li>
<li>The customer list should be persistent between executions.</li>
<li>A customer should have the ability to order one or more products.</li>
<li>Customers should not have the ability to view/print the customer list – administrator only function</li>
<li>Produce a customer listing sorted by customer name (at any time) - administrator only</li>
<li>Produce a customer listing sorted by customer name (at any time) containing only the “key” customers. – administrator only </li>
</ol>
